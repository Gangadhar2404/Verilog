# Verilog
Comprehensive Verilog HDL repository featuring combinational circuits, sequential designs, and FSM implementations. Includes adders, multiplexers, decoders, counters, shift registers, and Moore/Mealy machines. All modules are synthesizable, parameterized where applicable, and paired with simulation testbenches for verification and FPGA workflows.
