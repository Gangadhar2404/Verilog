# 8-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX) using If-Else Statement

This repository contains a **Verilog HDL implementation of an 8-to-1 multiplexer (MUX)** using nested `if-else` conditions inside an `always` block.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Description
A **multiplexer (MUX)** is a combinational circuit that selects one input from multiple inputs and forwards it to the output based on a **selection line**.  
This design implements an **8-to-1 MUX** using **if-else conditions**, which is functionally equivalent to the `case`-based design.

**Inputs:**
- `i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6, i7, i8` : Data inputs  
- `s[2:0]` : 3-bit selection line  

**Output:**
- `y` : Selected output

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Implements **8-to-1 MUX** functionality.  
- Uses **if-else ladder** instead of `case`.  
- Easy to understand for beginners.  
- Synthesizable for FPGA/ASIC designs.
