# All Gates Design ‚Äì Verilog HDL

## üìå Project Overview  
This project implements a unified **Verilog HDL** module that realizes six fundamental logic gates: **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**, **XNOR**, **NAND**, and **NOR**. The design is fully synthesizable and verified through a simulation testbench with waveform analysis. This serves as a foundational reference for digital logic design, FPGA prototyping, and ASIC synthesis.

## üîç Technical Description  
The `allgates` module accepts two single-bit inputs (`a` and `b`) and produces outputs corresponding to all six gate functions. It uses **continuous assignments** for combinational logic, ensuring minimal propagation delay and synthesis-friendly structure. The design is **technology-independent**, compatible with both FPGA and ASIC flows, and has been verified through exhaustive input simulation.
